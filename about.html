            my interest in programming/engineering began in 2014 and it's been growing ever since.

        <p>
            i fell in love with video games at a young age and knew that i wanted to learn how to create my own games.<br>
            i'm also very interested in composing music (mostly hip-hop) and other creative medium like photography and writing.</br>
        </p>
        <p>
            i live half an hour outside of malm&ouml; together with my girlfriend and our four pets (two dogs and two cats).
        </p>
        <p>
            i never want to stop learning. i want to learn more about the craft that i'm so passionate about; operating systems, compilers, hardware, assembly, c, rust etc.
